boundary is an array of two elements; each element can be 0, 1 or -1.
if we have a boundary {-1, 1} it means that we can't go in the "opposite direction of the x axis" (not on left)
and we can't go in the direction of the y axis (not down).
sum up: the first element of the vector tells us which direction on x we can't follow in that cell and
the second element tells us which direction on y we can't follow. If one of the element is 0 it means that
we have no boundary in that direction

conventions followed:
0,0 is the top left corner
x grows to the right
y grows to the bottom
arrays are 0 based
multidimensional arrays are fortran style (first index is the most rapidly varying) (column major)
