A few notes:
 - if your definitive branch is "restart" and "main" is not maintained anymore, it could be safer to state it in the readme, and/or to set "restart" to be the default branch (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch), so to avoid any misunderstanding
 - i would suggest also to add a couple of lines on how to compile and run the code to your README.md
 - maybe you're uploading also un-needed files (.vscode)
 - is there a reason for using float instead of double?
 - the code seems more c-like than c++-like; as next development, i would consider its modernisation
